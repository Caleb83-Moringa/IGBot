## How it works
IGBot consists of two parts, **a console app** and the **web automation**. 
When you run the program, it will prompt you for a _username_ and _password_ (your instagram login details).
You'll then be prompted for your prefered hashtag and then press *ENTER* and let it do its thing.


## Comments
The code can still be iproved; the Error Handling especially. Feel free however to fork the project and use it to build something cool
